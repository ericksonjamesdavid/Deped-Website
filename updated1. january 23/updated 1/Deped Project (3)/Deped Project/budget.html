            <h1><strong>DepEd eyes tighter collaboration with DBM, DOF to secure additional budget</strong></h1>

           <p style="text-align: justify;">
            PASIG CITY, 1 January 2025 – The Department of Education (DepEd) is exploring collaborative measures with the Department of Budget
            and Management (DBM) and the Department of Finance (DOF) to efficiently execute key basic education programs, following the 
            signing of the General Appropriations Act (GAA) for 2025 on December 30.
        </p>
        <p>
            While the education sector secured the largest allocation in the 2025 GAA at P1.055 trillion, DepEd aims to augment funding through
            unprogrammed appropriations and other constitutional mechanisms to support its key programs, including the DepEd Computerization 
            Program (DCP).
        </p>
        <p>
            Education Secretary Sonny Angara expressed optimism about addressing funding gaps, emphasizing the importance of inter-agency cooperation.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Education remains a top priority for this administration, and we will be working closely with the DBM and DOF to explore funding 
            mechanisms that will enable us to deliver our mandate. Education is everyone’s business and we’re aiming for closer collaboration,”
            Secretary Angara said.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Education Chief then emphasized the roles that DBM Secretary Amenah Pangandaman and DOF Secretary Ralph Recto will play in 
            securing additional funding for the agency.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Titiyakin namin na mananatiling prayoridad ang Social Services, kasama na po ang Edukasyon, ayon sa mandato ng ating Saligang 
            Batas, pati na rin ang Kalusugan,” Sec. Recto said.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sec. Pangandaman also noted that additional funding remains a viable path for affected priority programs. “As long as mayroon 
            tayong (we have an) additional revenue from the DOF, we can actually augment or increase the budget of DepEd, specifically for 
            computerization program,” she said during a press briefing on December 30.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sec. Angara likewise lauded President Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr. for exercising maximum prudence in signing the 2025 GAA and 
            prioritizing responsive and sustainable programs.
        </p>
        <p>
            “This budget reflects our collective commitment to transforming economic gains into meaningful outcomes for every Filipino. 
            It is designed not just to address our present needs, but to sustain growth and uplift the lives of generations that are yet to 
            come,” President Marcos Jr. said during the signing ceremony of GAA 2025.
        </p>
        <p>
            DepEd expressed gratitude for the President’s deliberate approach, noting that this provides a strong foundation for ensuring that 
            the education sector continues to receive strategic support to fulfill its mandate.
        </p>
        <p>
            “DepEd remains hopeful that its partnership with government agencies and stakeholders will help address ongoing challenges and 
            ensure that critical initiatives address the needs of Filipino learners,” Angara said.
