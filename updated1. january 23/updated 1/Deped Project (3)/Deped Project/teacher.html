            <h1><strong>DepEd priritizes teacher and personnel concerns with reconstituted uniform committee</strong></h1>

           <p style="text-align: justify;">
            PASIG CITY, 9 January 2025 — The Department of Education (DepEd) has reaffirmed its commitment to addressing the pressing concerns of its workforce regarding uniforms by reconstituting the Department of Education Uniform Committee (DUC).
        </p><br>
        <p>
            In DepEd Memorandum No. 004, s. 2025, the Department aims to foster greater inclusivity and practicality in uniform policies with the newly reconstituted DUC instructed to oversee the selection, implementation, and monitoring of DepEd uniforms for School Years 2024-2025 and 2025-2026.
        </p><br>
        <p>
            The committee’s primary goal is to ensure that uniforms are professional and appropriate for the working conditions and environments in schools nationwide, in response to the Civil Service Commission Memorandum Circular No. 16, s. 2024, which revises the dress code for government officials and employees.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Until the new internal dress code of DepEd is finalized, all field personnel are advised to adhere to DM-OUHROD-2022-0042, entitled “Wearing of the Prescribed DepEd Uniform and Office Attire.” DepEd has been given six months to draft and release internal guidelines that align with CSC’s updated policies.
        </p><br>
        <p>
            “We want to foster a more inclusive, practical, and supportive approach to uniform policies. This initiative not only reflects DepEd’s responsiveness to the needs of its personnel but also its commitment to strengthening the education system for the benefit of all stakeholders,” Secretary Sonny Angara said. 
        </p><br>
        <p>
            In addition, the DUC will include representatives from nine (9) national organizations and associations of teachers and non-teaching employees to ensure that uniform policies reflect the voices of stakeholders.
        </p><br>
        <p>
            The committee will be chaired by the Undersecretary for Human Resource and Organizational Development, with the Assistant Secretary for Operations serving as Vice-Chairperson.</p><br>
            The LSCP must be crafted every three years alongside the School Improvement Plan, and will be reviewed and updated annually at the 
            start of the school year.
        </p><br>
        <p>
            Organizations are required to submit their permanent representatives by January 17, 2025, via email to bhrod.ewd@deped.gov.ph.
