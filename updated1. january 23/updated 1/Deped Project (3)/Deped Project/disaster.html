            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                PASIG CITY, 27 December 2024 â€“ The Department of Education (DepEd) has updated measures to strengthen the preparedness of schools 
                for disasters and other emergencies, emphasizing the importance of Learning and Service Continuity Plans (LSCPs) in minimizing the
                 disruption of learning delivery.<br>
            </p><br>
            <p>
                In DepEd Order No. 022, s. 2024, the Department provided the revised guidelines on class and work suspensions in schools during 
                typhoons and tropical cyclones, heavy rainfall and flood, earthquakes, power outages, extreme heat, low air quality, and other 
                emergencies and hazards. The policy also outlines steps to safeguard students and teachers while ensuring learning continuity.
            </p><br>
            <p>
                The LSCP mandates field offices and schools to identify suitable Alternative Delivery Modes (ADMs) for education, ensuring that 
                even during calamities, students have access to learning resources. These ADMs may include modular distance learning, online 
                education, or blended approaches, depending on the specific needs and local conditions.<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                The LSCP must also establish protocols for the safekeeping and storage of learning materials and devices to prevent damage during 
                calamities. The plan must also detail procedures for distributing these materials, ensuring that learners can easily access them 
                when needed.
            </p><br>
            <p>
                In addition, the LSCP includes guidelines for mobilizing teachers, school heads, and other staff during emergencies. Training 
                programs and capacity building activities, such as Learning Action Cells, must be pivoted to prepare educators for the challenges
                of remote or alternative teaching methods.   
            </p><br>
            <p>
                The LSCP also draws on assistance from local government units, parents, and community organizations to generate resources and 
                ensure smooth implementation of continuity plans.
            </p><br>
            <p>
                Furthermore, schools are directed to integrate funding needs for disaster preparedness and recovery into their School Improvement
                 Plans. This ensures that resources for ADMs, make- up classes, and other initiatives are readily available when emergencies occur.
            </p><br>
                The LSCP must be crafted every three years alongside the School Improvement Plan, and will be reviewed and updated annually at the 
                start of the school year.
            </p><br>
            <p>
